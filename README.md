# PRODIGY_TrackCode_TaskNumber
This repository contains four Java projects developed as part of my Prodigy Internship tasks. Each project demonstrates different Java concepts ranging from core programming to GUI and web scraping.

üìÇ Projects

GuessingGame
A console-based Java program where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. It covers basic control flow, loops, and user input handling.

IdpWebScraper
A Maven-based Java project that scrapes information from websites. It demonstrates networking, file I/O, and working with external libraries.

SudokuSolver
A JavaFX GUI application for solving Sudoku puzzles. It showcases GUI development, event handling, and problem-solving algorithms.

TemperatureConverterFx
A JavaFX application for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It demonstrates GUI design, event-driven programming, and basic mathematical operations.
